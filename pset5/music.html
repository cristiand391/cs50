    <h4>Music:</h4>
    <p>
      Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. General definitions of music
      include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts
      tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture
      (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize,
      de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal
      techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as
      songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments.
    </p>

    <p>A <strong>music genre</strong> is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a
      shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from <i>musical form</i> and <i>musical
        style</i>, although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Recently, academics have argued
      that categorizing music by genre is inaccurate and outdated.
